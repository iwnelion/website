# My personal website
this is my personal website as a web developer, part of the Odin project. it's a one-page website, including sections about me, my skills and my tools, some of my projects and contact information. 

**Link to project:** https://iwnelion.github.io/website/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS.

i wanted a minimalistic design, so i chose a simple font which is easy to read and compatible with all browsers. so, i chose the arial font. with the same mindset, i chose two colors similar to white and black, since i didn't want a high contrast betweet the letters and the background. i started with my name, my title and a quick description about what i do. in the skills section, i made a table with the languages and some tools i use. for my projects, i made gifs of the sites and added a quick description to some, including a link in all of them for the actual site. in the contact section, i added images with the logos of the social media which have links to my profiles. on the header at the top of the page, there is a menu with anchor tag links for each section.

## Optimizations

after finishing this project, i thought i could have been more creative on the font option. i could have chosen a different font for the headings, if not for the entire website. also i could have added a favicon.

## Lessons Learned:

i challenged myself to use both floats and flexbox in order to get more comfortable with the second. in the skills section, i used some nested lists and managed to handle their padding and margin.
