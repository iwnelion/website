# My personal website
this is my personal website as a web developer, part of the Odin project. it's a one-page website, including sections about me, my skills and my tools, some of my projects and contact information. 

**Link to project:** https://iwnelion.github.io/website/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS.
i wanted a minimalistic design, so i chose a simple font which is easy to read and compatible with all browsers. so, i chose the arial font. with the same mindset, i chose two colors similar to white and black, since i didn't want a high contrast betweet the letters and the background. i started with my name, my title and a quick description about what i do. in the skills section, i made a table with the languages and some tools i use. for my projects, i made gifs of the sites and added a quick description to some, including a link in all of them for the actual site. in the contact section, i added images with the logos of the social media which have links to my profiles.

## Optimizations
You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *wow I actually did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
